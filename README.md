# support-vector-classification
In this project we will built this Support Vector Machine for classification (shown below) using scikit-learn to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease

We will go through 4 tasks to implement our project:

Task 1: Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset.

Task 2: Checking missing values.

Task 3: Creating visual methods to analyze the data.

Task 4: make Support vector machine classification model
